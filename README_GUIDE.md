## 🎯 Current Setup for DevYukis

### Scenario 1: Personal Account

If `DevYukis` is a **personal account**:

```
DevYukis/DevYukis/    ← Special profile repo
├── README.md                          ← Your profile (visible on https://github.com/DevYukis)
├── PROJECT_README.md                  ← Project documentation
├── .github/
│   └── profile/
│       └── README.md                  ← Not used for personal accounts
└── ...
```

**To Use:**
1. Create a repo named exactly `DevYukis` (same as your username)
2. Add `README.md` - this becomes your profile
3. It will automatically show on your profile page

---

### Scenario 2: Organization

If `DevYukis` is an **organization**:

```
DevYukis/.github/             ← Special .github repo
├── profile/
│   └── README.md                      ← Organization profile
└── ...

DevYukis/GITNPPP/             ← Project repository
├── README.md                          ← Project documentation
└── ...
```

**To Use:**
1. Create a repo named `.github` in your organization
2. Add `profile/README.md` - this becomes your organization profile
3. Each project has its own `README.md`
